# zfb Integration Probe Report

**Probe date:** 2026-05-09
**zfb commit verified against:** `aa8e9ac`

This report documents the four zfb gaps surfaced during the planning probe for sub-issue #33 (epic #29: Examples Deploy + zfb Demo). All four were fixed upstream before the zfb demo implementation (sub-issue #35) began.

## Upstream fixes — resolved zfb issues

All four issues have been closed and re-verified against zfb commit `3f58127` (original probe); zfb example re-verified against `aa8e9ac` as part of epic #108 (see Bug history below):

| zfb # | Bug | Fix commit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [#228](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-front-builder/issues/228) | `<a href="/foo">` not prefixed by `base` | `d6fc3fe` | ✅ verified |
| [#229](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-front-builder/issues/229) | Dev server served at root with `base`-prefixed asset URLs that 404 | `b1049ef` | ✅ verified |
| [#230](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-front-builder/issues/230) | `devMiddleware` rejected POST/PUT/DELETE | `f72d2ae` | ✅ verified |
| [#231](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-front-builder/issues/231) | `dist/.zfb-build/` build intermediates shipped in deploy | `e876681` | ✅ verified |

## Bug history — zdtp internal fixes (epic #108, PR #113)

Two bugs affecting the deployed Cloudflare Pages examples were diagnosed and fixed in [epic #108](https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-design-token-panel/issues/108).

**Bug 1 — Astro example rendered an empty panel body.** The Astro consumer's Vite build deduplicates chunks in a way that placed `panel-config.ts` into two separate module instances: one in the host-adapter chunk and one in the panel's main chunk. The host adapter wrote `configuredConfig` to its instance; the panel read from the other instance (still `null`), so `getPanelConfig()` returned `DEFAULT_PANEL_CONFIG` with `tabs: []`. Fix (#109): the configuration singleton is now stored on `globalThis[Symbol.for('@takazudo/zdtp:singleton')]` so any number of module instances share the same state slot regardless of bundler chunk layout.

**Bug 2 — zfb first `toggleDesignPanel()` call was a no-op** when the browser's localStorage contained legacy keys from the default storage prefix (e.g. `zudo-design-token-panel:visible=1`). At module-init time, `reapplyFromStorage()` ran with the default prefix before `configurePanel(zfbConfig)` was called. This mounted a default-prefix Preact panel, which then removed the zfb-prefix open key as a side effect, so the zfb panel's mount-effect read `null` and never called `setOpen(true)`. Fix (#111): a post-configure hook system defers `reapplyPersistedOverrides()` and `reapplyFromStorage()` until `configurePanel()` has supplied the host's storage prefix. Existing consumers need no code changes.

Both fixes are transparent to host consumers.

## Integration nuance — apply endpoint and `devMiddleware` base-mounting (zfb #229)

### Historical context (pre-2026-05-19 move) — base-prefixed path required

The panel's `applyEndpoint` in the zfb demo **must be the full base-prefixed URL**:

```
/pj/zudo-design-token-panel/examples/zfb/api/dev/apply
```

Do **not** use the bare relative path (`api/dev/apply`) that the other three examples (astro, vite-react, next) use. After fix #229, zfb's dev server mounts `devMiddleware` paths under `base`, so the apply endpoint is only reachable at the fully-prefixed path.

This is a configuration requirement for this project, not a bug in zfb.

### Post-move (2026-05-19) — bare path now works because `base: '/'`

After the demo was moved to its own standalone repo (`Takazudo/zudo-design-token-panel-example-zfb`), `base` was changed from `/pj/zudo-design-token-panel/examples/zfb/` to `/`. The zfb #229 base-mounting behaviour still applies — `devMiddleware` handlers are mounted under `base` — but with `base: '/'`, the bare path `/api/dev/apply` IS the fully-prefixed path. The `applyEndpoint` and `APPLY_ROUTE` in `plugins/dev-apply-proxy.mjs` are therefore set to `/api/dev/apply`, matching the other three examples. The zfb #229 reference remains relevant: the mechanism is unchanged; only the base value changed.

## Process for new zfb issues

If a new zfb gap is discovered during the zfb demo implementation (#35 or later):

1. **File a minimal repro issue** on the zfb repo (https://github.com/Takazudo/zudo-front-builder/issues) with steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and the zfb commit SHA being tested.
2. **Add a row** to the upstream-fix table in this report (and in `__inbox/zfb-probe-report.md`) with the issue number and a ⏳ status.
3. **Wait for the upstream fix** (or implement a workaround in the zdtp demo with a comment referencing the open issue) before completing the sub-issue.
4. **Update the row** to ✅ verified once the fix commit is confirmed and the issue is closed.
