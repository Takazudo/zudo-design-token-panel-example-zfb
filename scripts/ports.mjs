/**
 * Single source of truth for the three ports this harness binds.
 *
 * `ZFB_PORT` / `ZDTP_PORT` / `PREVIEW_PORT` let concurrent git worktrees of
 * this repo run side by side. Everything that needs one reads it from here —
 * the dev server, the preview server, the `/api/dev/apply` proxy target, the
 * sidecar's `--allow-origin` list, Playwright's `baseURL` and its webServer —
 * so no two of them can drift apart.
 *
 * Digits-only is deliberate, not pedantry. Every consumer that is not JS gets
 * the value as an argv string, while JS parses it with `Number()`. Anything JS
 * coerces but a port parser does not — `' '` (-> 0), `'1e4'`, `'0x20'` — would
 * otherwise bind one port while telling another process about a different one,
 * and the sidecar's CORS check would then reject every /apply POST with no hint
 * as to why. That exact desync was found in review on the vite-react sibling,
 * inside the fix meant to prevent it.
